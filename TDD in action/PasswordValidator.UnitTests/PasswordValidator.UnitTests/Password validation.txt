Design and implement a software that validates a password applying TDD.

The password will be introduced by the user (as an argument of the method) and should return if the password is valid or not.

A valid password should meet the following requirements:

Have at least 8 characters
Contains a capital letter
Contains a lowercase
Contains a number
Contains an underscore

Technical requirements:

We want a method that answers if the password is valid or not.
In case the password is below 8 characters, we want to throw an ArgumentException with the message "Password is too short".
